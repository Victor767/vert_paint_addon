# Verticies Color paint addon

It is often needed to paint verticies of the objects in different colors before exporting to engine as engines shaders require it to be painted in one way or another to function properly. This addon is optimized for the project I'm currently involved in so just now it allows to paint verticies in 3 different colors: black, white and red. This is enough for now but if it will be required or requested I'll extend addon's functionality further to paint other colors.

This addon adds buttons to the separate panel in Object Data Properties tab of Blender with the following functions:

1. Paint Object Verticies Black - paints all the verticies of selected object(s) in black color. This means literally all verticies of selected object(s) shall be painted white despite what color thay had earlier. If you need to paint only certain verticies of your object select them in Edit Mode and use buttons 4-6.
2. Paint Object Verticies White - paints all the verticies of selected object(s) in white color. This means literally all verticies of selected object(s) shall be painted white despite what color thay had earlier. If you need to paint only certain verticies of your object select them in Edit Mode and use buttons 4-6.
3. Paint Object Verticies Red - paints all the verticies of selected object(s) in red color. This means literally all verticies of selected object(s) shall be painted red despite what color thay had earlier. If you need to paint only certain verticies of your object select them in Edit Mode and use buttons 4-6.
4. Paint Selected Verticies Black - paints all selected verticies in black color leaving all non-selected verticies intact. If you press this button in Object Mode it will paint all the object(s)'s verticies in black color and enter Edit Mode selecting all the verticies. But for this you can use buttons 1-3 and buttons 4-6 are intended to operate in Edit Mode by selecting only certain verticies which have to be painted black.
5. Paint Selected Verticies White - paints all selected verticies in white color leaving all non-selected verticies intact. If you press this button in Object Mode it will paint all the object(s)'s verticies in white color and enter Edit Mode selecting all the verticies. But for this you can use buttons 1-3 and buttons 4-6 are intended to operate in Edit Mode by selecting only certain verticies which have to be painted white.
6. Paint Selected Verticies Red - paints all selected verticies in red color leaving all non-selected verticies intact. If you press this button in Object Mode it will paint all the object(s)'s verticies in red color and enter Edit Mode selecting all the verticies. But for this you can use buttons 1-3 and buttons 4-6 are intended to operate in Edit Mode by selecting only certain verticies which have to be painted red.
7. Remove any Verticies Color from Object - removes any Color Attribute data from geometry. It is Color Attribute data which holds any kind of information on the verticies color so by removing it we make sure that the geometry is clean of information about vertex color if we don't need it.

It is handy to use it as when any button is pressed it not only paints the verticies but also changes the Viewport Shading Mode to Solid and Color Type to Attribute even before painting so the result of verticies painting is visible without necessity to change anything in 3D Viewport. When finished painting verticies you can then change the Shading mode and Color type (if in Solid mode) to whatever you got used to.

Addon is always inform you on the Status bar if the operations is performed successfully.

When addon is installed it adds panel to Object Data Properties tab on the bottom of the stack. It makes sense to keep this panel right beneath Color Attributes panel so you can drag it to the place by dragging the grip located to the right of the panel name. It will stay there until you close the project so to leave it there forever I would advice to move it right after you create a new scene and then save its position by saving Startup File (File -> Defaults -> Save Startup File).
